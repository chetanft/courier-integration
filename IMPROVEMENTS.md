# API Functionality and cURL Parsing Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the API functionality and cURL parsing in the Courier Integration platform.

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented a comprehensive refactoring of the API functionality and cURL parsing to address the issues identified in the analysis. The changes include:

1. **Centralized API Service**: Created a modular, centralized API service architecture
2. **Improved cURL Parser**: Enhanced the cURL parser with better error handling and security
3. **Courier Registry**: Implemented a configuration-based approach for courier-specific logic
4. **Authentication Service**: Created a dedicated service for token management
5. **Standardized Error Handling**: Implemented consistent error handling across the application
6. **Response Size Management**: Added support for handling large API responses

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. Centralized API Service

- Created `api-service-core.js` with core API functionality
- Implemented `courier-api-service-new.js` for courier-specific API handling
- Created `courier-api-client.js` as a high-level client for application code
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

Benefits:
- Reduced code duplication
- Consistent error handling
- Easier to add new features
- Better separation of concerns

### 2. Improved cURL Parser

- Enhanced error handling for malformed cURL commands
- Added proper URL validation
- Improved security by redacting sensitive information
- Added support for more cURL parameters
- Better handling of different content types
- More robust parsing of headers and authentication

Benefits:
- More reliable parsing of cURL commands
- Better security for sensitive information
- Support for more complex cURL commands
- Improved error messages for debugging

### 3. Courier Registry

- Created `courier-registry.js` for centralized courier configuration
- Moved courier-specific logic to configuration
- Implemented standardized response mapping
- Added support for courier-specific request transformations

Benefits:
- Easy to add new couriers without modifying core code
- Consistent handling of courier-specific logic
- Better maintainability and extensibility
- Standardized response format across different couriers

### 4. Authentication Service

- Created `auth-service.js` for centralized authentication
- Implemented token caching and refresh
- Added support for different authentication methods
- Improved security for token handling

Benefits:
- Consistent authentication across the application
- Automatic token refresh for expired tokens
- Reduced redundant authentication requests
- Better security for sensitive credentials

### 5. Standardized Error Handling

- Implemented consistent error types and messages
- Created standardized error response format
- Added detailed error information for debugging
- Improved user-friendly error messages

Benefits:
- Easier to debug API issues
- Better user experience with meaningful error messages
- Consistent error handling across the application
- More detailed error information for developers

### 6. Response Size Management

- Added support for pagination
- Implemented response size checking
- Added filtering capabilities for large responses
- Improved handling of Netlify's 6MB response size limit

Benefits:
- Prevents issues with large API responses
- Better performance with paginated responses
- Reduced memory usage
- Avoids Netlify function size limits

## New Files

- `src/lib/api-service-core.js`: Core API functionality
- `src/lib/auth-service.js`: Authentication service
- `src/lib/courier-registry.js`: Courier configuration registry
- `src/lib/courier-api-service-new.js`: New courier API service
- `src/lib/courier-api-client.js`: High-level API client
- `src/examples/api-client-usage.js`: Usage examples

## Modified Files

- `src/lib/curl-parser.js`: Improved cURL parsing
- `src/lib/api-utils.js`: Updated to use new implementation
- `src/lib/utils.js`: Added utility functions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tracking Example

```javascript
import { trackShipment } from '../lib/courier-api-client';

// Track a shipment
const trackingResponse = await trackShipment({
  courier: 'safexpress',
  trackingNumber: '123456789'
});

// Access standardized fields
console.log('Status:', trackingResponse.status);
```

### Authentication Example

```javascript
import { generateToken } from '../lib/courier-api-client';

// Generate a token
const tokenResponse = await generateToken({
  courier: 'freighttiger',
  credentials: {
    username: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password'
  }
});

// Extract the token
const token = tokenResponse.data?.token || tokenResponse.access_token;
```

### Custom Request Example

```javascript
import { makeCustomRequest } from '../lib/courier-api-client';

// Make a custom request
const response = await makeCustomRequest({
  courier: 'safexpress',
  endpoint: 'epod',
  method: 'POST',
  body: {
    docNo: '123456789',
    docType: 'WB'
  }
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for the new implementation
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation with usage examples
3. **UI Integration**: Update UI components to use the new API client
4. **Migration**: Gradually migrate existing code to use the new implementation

## Conclusion

These improvements address the issues identified in the analysis and provide a more robust, maintainable, and secure implementation of the API functionality and cURL parsing in the Courier Integration platform. The changes maintain backward compatibility while providing a path forward for new development.
